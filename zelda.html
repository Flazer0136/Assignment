                        <p>The Legend of Zelda series is one of the most iconic and beloved franchises in gaming history. Created by legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (who also created other iconic Nintendo franchises like Mario and Donkey Kong), the first game was released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
                        <br>
                        <br> Miyamoto drew inspiration for the series from his childhood experiences exploring the forests, caves and lakes near his home in Japan. He wanted to create a game that captured the sense of adventure and exploration he felt as a child â€“ and The Legend of Zelda was the result!

                                <br>The Legend of Zelda is the first installment in the Zelda franchise, and its success allowed the development of many sequels in the spawn of over three decades. The game itself introduces a new level of gaming for its time, one that includes roleplaying, action, adventure, and puzzle/logic.
                                <br>
                                <br>The goal of The Legend of Zelda is to collect the 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, defeat Ganon, and to rescue Princess Zelda. To obtain the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, the player must take on the role of the hero, Link, and explore the first eight dungeons in the game before embarking on the journey to the final dungeon, Level 9: Death Mountain, to defeat the evil wizard Ganon.

                                <br>A little under a year after the international first installment of the series, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, taking the series in a different direction with this side-scrolling adventure.
                                <br>
                                <br>The Adventure of Link is without a doubt the hardest Zelda game to date according to most fans of the series. One of these challenges was the aspect of introducing a "lives system" that further made the game frustrating when Link ran out of lives and was forced to return to the starting area, having to traverse across Hyrule and back into the treacherous dungeons where they fell.

The game was also the first in the franchise to have a real, tangible art style. The previous installments on the NES, due to resolution and color limitations were unable to attain this.

                                <br>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is the seventeenth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series.

                                <br>
                                <br>A Link Between Worlds added a brand new gameplay mechanic to the Legend of Zelda series with the wall merging mechanic. This combines top down and side scrolling gameplay, creating never before puzzle opportunities. This makes it so that Link can get to areas in dungeons and the overworld that are seemingly impossible to reach, by merging into a wall and safely crossing hazards below.
